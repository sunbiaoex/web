<h1>About me</h1>

{% include image.html url="/images/sunbiao.jpeg" caption="Me at Hainan in 2013" width=300 align="right" %}

<p>In July 2013, I started as an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/seea/">School of Electrical and Information Engineering</a>, at <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/">Tianjin University (TJU)</a>.</p>

<p>I'm also a visiting research fellow with Department of Ophthalmology, <a href="https://www.nuh.com.sg/">National University Hospital (NUH)</a>, Singapore.</p>

<p>Before joining TJU, I received the Ph.D. degree in Electronics Science and Technology (Signal Processing) from <a href="http://www.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)</a> in 2013, under the supervision of <a href="http://oei.hust.edu.cn/Teacher/18536149.htm">Prof. Jianjun Jiang</a>.</p>
