My research interests are generally in the areas of **sparse signal representation/compressed sensing, biomedical signal processing, neural signal recording, and wearable/wireless healthcare**.

1. Sparse signal representation/compressed sensing (SSR/CS) is a new signal processing and data analysis technique.
